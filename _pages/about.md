I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at **Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT)**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Game Theory**, specifically studying how agents make optimal decisions in environments with imperfect information.

I am deeply interested in the mathematics behind strategy. My work focuses on understanding **Algorithmic Game Theory** through the lens of **Poker**, analyzing risk, probability, and human-like decision-making in stochastic systems.

I am currently seeking research opportunities to explore:
* **Reinforcement Learning** in competitive games.
* **Quantitative Analysis** and probability theory.
* **Multi-Agent Systems** and strategic reasoning.

### Research Interests

* **Algorithmic Game Theory:** Nash Equilibria, Imperfect Information Games (Poker).
* **Machine Learning:** Decision-making under uncertainty.
* **Quantitative Finance:** Risk analysis and market microstructure.
* **Mathematics:** Probability and Statistics.
